# Weather Station Interface

This project is a C# application realised with Windows Forms and designed to interface with an SCD30 environmental sensor module, which measures CO2 concentration, temperature, and humidity. The application retrieves, processes, displays, and stores environmental data while supporting user account management and customizable alerts. <br/>
The project was carried out in pairs.

# Features

* Data Collection: Automatically retrieves data from the SCD30 sensor (CO2, temperature, humidity) via USB.
* Real-Time Data Display: Displays environmental data (CO2, temperature, humidity) in a data grid with time-based updates. <br/><img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6748e874-4e5e-406a-8bed-938595637795" alt="Data Display Image" width="400"/><br/>
